To display important server information on login, you can edit the /etc/motd file (Message Of The Day) or create a script in /etc/profile.d/ that runs on login, allowing you to customize the displayed information. 
Here's a breakdown of how to achieve this:
1. Using /etc/motd (Simple Method):
Edit the file: Open /etc/motd with a text editor (e.g., sudo nano /etc/motd). 
Add your information: Insert the information you want to display, such as hostname, IP address, uptime, etc. 
Example:
Code

    Welcome to the server!
    Hostname: $(hostname)
    IP Address: $(ip a | grep -oP 'inet \K[\d.]+')
    Uptime: $(uptime -s)
Save the file: Save the changes and close the editor. 
2. Using a Script in /etc/profile.d/ (More Flexible):
Create a script: Create a new file in /etc/profile.d/ (e.g., sudo nano /etc/profile.d/server_info.sh).
Make it executable: sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/server_info.sh.
Add your commands: Write a script that displays the desired information. For example: 
Code

    #!/bin/bash
    echo -e "\n"
    echo -e "--------------------------------------------------------"
    echo -e "Server Information:"
    echo -e "--------------------------------------------------------"
    echo -e "Hostname: $(hostname)"
    echo -e "IP Address: $(ip a | grep -oP 'inet \K[\d.]+')"
    echo -e "Uptime: $(uptime -s)"
    echo -e "--------------------------------------------------------"
    echo -e "\n"
Save and test: Save the script and test it by logging in or running sudo bash /etc/profile.d/server_info.sh. 
3. Additional Tips:
lastlog command: You can use the lastlog command to display the last login information.
uptime command: Use the uptime command to show the server's uptime.
hostname command: Use the hostname command to display the server's hostname.
ip a command: Use the ip a command to display the IP addresses.
df -h command: Use the df -h command to display disk space usage.
free -h command: Use the free -h command to display memory usage.
Customization: You can customize the script to display any information you deem important, such as system load, disk usage, or recent log messages.
